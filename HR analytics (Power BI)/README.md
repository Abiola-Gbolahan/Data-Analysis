#  HR Dashboard: Employee Promotion and Retrenchment Analysis with Power BI (This is my first Power BI Dashboard)
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I used Excel, Power BI, and DAX expressions to analyze HR data and provide actionable workforce insights.
The analysis focuses on employees due for promotion, at risk of retrenchment, and those who fall into both categories (eligible for retrenchment with gratuity). The Power BI dashboard presents clear visual insights for HR teams to make data-driven decisions.
This project is also a reflection of my learning journey. After mastering Python, Excel, and SQL, I scaled up to Power BI to align with modern industry requirements and deliver interactive business intelligence solutions.
## Datasets
The project is built from two HR datasets:
- [HR Analytics Data.csv](https://github.com/Abiola-Gbolahan/Data-Analysis/blob/main/HR%20analytics%20(Power%20BI)/HR%20Analytics%20Data.csv)
- [HR Employee Data.csv](https://github.com/Abiola-Gbolahan/Data-Analysis/blob/main/HR%20analytics%20(Power%20BI)/HR%20employee%20data.csv)
Both datasets contain information about employee demographics, promotion eligibility, and retrenchment status.
## Dashboard Insights
From the analysis, the following insights were derived:
- Total Employees: 1,470
Gender Breakdown:
- Male: 882 (60%)
- Female: 588 (40%)
- Employees Due for Promotion: 72
- Employees to be Retrenched: 117
Employees Appearing in Both Lists: These employees will be retrenched with gratuity.
## Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard includes three main pages:
- Home Page â€“ High-level overview of total employees, gender split, and workforce summary.
- Action Page â€“ Details of employees due for promotion and those to be retrenched.
- Detail Page â€“ Specific employee names and whether they are in both categories.
This structure makes it easy for HR managers to quickly view workforce status and make informed decisions.

## Tools & Skills Used
- Excel â†’ Data cleaning, preparation, and transformation.
- Power BI â†’ Data modeling, visualization, and storytelling.
- DAX Expressions â†’ Custom measures and calculated fields for accurate reporting.
## Learnings & Passion
This project demonstrates my passion for continuous learning. I initially mastered Excel, SQL, and Python for analysis, and later scaled up into Power BI and DAX to meet modern industry needs. And this is my first Power BI Project/dashboard.
By combining data cleaning, modeling, and visualization, I can now provide end-to-end business intelligence solutions.
